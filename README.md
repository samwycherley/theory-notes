# Game Theory

These are some notes I started during my masters and which have grown much longer ever since. They are still a work-in-progress.

Lots of unfinished new sections at the moment.

If you find errors/typos etc., please let me know.

I am also part-way through writing notes on decision theory. I will put these up when they are less incomplete.
